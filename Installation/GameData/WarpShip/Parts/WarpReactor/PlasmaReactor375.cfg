	manufacturer = WarpTech Industries
	description = This reactor also converts Warp Plasma into usable electrical energy via a patented and top-secret process involving a lot of fancy physics words, and is able to achieve higher conversion efficiency due to its larger size. The reason making the reactor bigger makes it work better is also patented and top secret, of course.
