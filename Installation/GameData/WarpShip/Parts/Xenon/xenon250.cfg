	description = The Xenon Concentrator is designed to filter Xenon out of Athmosphere, and thus must have access to an appropriate atmospheric scoop. Some Kerbal scientists think that the large concentration of Xenon in Jool's atmosphere is why it glows green, but others contend that doesn't actually make any sense.
