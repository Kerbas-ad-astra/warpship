	description = It was initially suspected that the Joolian Gas Collector inventor Joolia Kerman's main interest in the planet Jool was the similarity in their names, but she assures us that the reasons are much deeper and more complicated. Such as both she and Jool being green, for example. Jool's athmosphere is unusually rich in Xenon. If you have a good pilot, you can scoop it up without falling victim to Jool's excessive gravity.
