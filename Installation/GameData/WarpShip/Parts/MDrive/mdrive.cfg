description = The M-Drive was discovered after a failed attempt to heat up some popcron. When the oven started to move by itself, Von Kerman's interest was peaked. A few tests and a lot of burnt popcorn later he presented the M-Drive, also called the impossible drive... Von Kerman figured out how to make it work, but why... nobody knows. And they still didn't have popcorn.
