0.3.8: June 22 2016
- Compiled against KSP 1.1.3

0.3.7: June 20 2016
- Modified MainHull to have a Tokamak Reactor
- Modified FuelTank to contain LqdDeuterium and LqdHe3
- mod now also depends on CommunityResourcePack
- Modified SupportRing to contain Portable Hadron Collider
- Modified Joolscoop to extract XenonGas from any Athmosphere (i hope)
- Replaced IXSCommandPod’s IVA with FatCholesterol’s StarTrek-like IVA 
- resource flow for warp drive is now as follows:
Solar Panels -> ElectricCharge + LqdDeuterium (in Tokamak) -> more ElectricCharge(1.21GW!!!!) + LqdHe3 (in PHC) -> eXoticMatter + ElectricCharge + XenonGas (in Alcubierre Drive) = Warpspeed
